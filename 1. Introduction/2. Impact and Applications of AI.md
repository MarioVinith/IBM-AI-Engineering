## Types of AI

- Weak (narrow) AI        : Specific domains
- Strong (generalized) AI : Diverse capabilities across unrelated tasks
- Super (conscious) AI    : Human level consciousness

## Artificial vs Augmented Intelligence

| Artificial Intelligence                                                    | Augmented Intelligence                                                      |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Just Machine <br/>thinking and executing tasks                             | A combination of human and machine intelligence<br/>eg: car collision alarm |
| Should be used for repetitive tasks<br/>where we need less margin of error | Combining Human's creativity & emotional intelligence with machines.        |

## Generative AI

- Generates content across various mediums.
- Human like conversations
- Data Augmentation

> **LLM's** are Models based on advanced neural network architectures, for processing and generating human-like text

> In Gen AI space, LLM's are usually outside your organisation (it's **BIG**) and if needed for our specific business case, we use a layer called 'prompting and tuning' these LLMs to our need and feed the result to our application.
> The feedback loop runs from the application to the prompting and tuning layer.

## Different types of AI

```text
The different types of AI include:

- Diagnostic/descriptive AI:
       Focuses on assessing the correctness of behavior by analyzing historical data to understand what happened and why.

- Predictive AI: 
        Concerned with forecasting future outcomes based on historical and current data.

- Prescriptive AI: 
        Focuses on determining the optimal course of action by providing recommendations based on data analysis.

- Generative/cognitive AI: 
        Involved in producing various types of content, such as code, articles, images, and more.

- Reactive AI: 
        Designed to respond to specific inputs with predetermined responses.

- Limited memory AI: 
        Have the ability to use past experiences to inform current decisions.

- Theory of Mind AI: 
        Advanced type of AI that aims to understand human emotions, beliefs, and intentions.

- Self-aware AI: 
        Represents the most advanced form of AI, which has its own consciousness and self-awareness.

- Narrow AI (Weak AI): 
        Designed to perform a specific task or a limited range of tasks.

- General AI (Strong AI): 
        Can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks like human intelligence.
